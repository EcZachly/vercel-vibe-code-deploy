# Day 1 Assignment: Build a Landing Page

Your first assignment is to build a high-fidelity landing page clone. 

## Instructions

To achieve the best results, you should use our visual-first cloning workflow. You can initiate this by doing **one** of the following:

### Option A: Use the existing skill
If you already have the cloning instructions loaded, simply mention it in your prompt (e.g., `@website-clone-guide.md`) and provide the reference URL you want to clone.

### Option B: Install from the Plugin Marketplace
If you don't have the skill installed yet, you can easily grab it from the SylphAI Skills repository (https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/skills).

1. In your AdaL CLI, run the following command to install:
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add SylphAI-Inc/skills
   ```
2. Once installed, mention the newly added clone website skill in your prompt.
3. Follow the detailed instruction steps provided by the skill to scaffold, extract, and polish your landing page clone.
