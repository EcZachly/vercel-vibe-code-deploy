# Agent Instructions

Welcome to the `adal-vibecoding-bootcamp` repository!

## Project Overview
This repository contains materials and code for the AdaL Vibecoding Bootcamp.

## Repository Structure
- `class-materials/`: Contains presentation slides and the bootcamp curriculum.
- `landing-page/`: Original Next.js landing page project.
- `landing_page_2/`: Updated Next.js landing page project with additional features.

## Guidelines for AI Agents
- **Next.js**: Both landing page projects use Next.js with the App Router.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is the primary styling solution.
- **Commits**: Follow conventional commit formats (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).
- **Navigation**: Always verify the current working directory before running package manager commands, as there are multiple frontend projects in this monorepo-style structure.
